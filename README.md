## Overview

### Description

Cancelling service while still within the minimum contractual term may result in early cancellation fee (sometimes also called early termination fee). 

- Add up all the benefits that customer got by signing the contract. These may include price reduction, extra channels, free device etc.
- Monthly charge x remaining number of months

This means that the customer chooses whether he will pay the total amount of monthly subscriptions until the end of the minimum contractual term or whether he will pay for all the benefits he has received by signing the contract.
